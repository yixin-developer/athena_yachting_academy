            <p>The RYA‚Äôs standards are rigorous and strictly enforced. Every recognized sailing centre undergoes a detailed annual inspection covering yacht condition, instructor qualifications, equipment, and course materials.</p>
            <p>All vessels used for RYA courses must be commercially licensed, fully insured, and equipped with approved safety and navigation systems. These requirements exceed most international boating regulations ‚Äî including those in Greece ‚Äî ensuring every RYA sailing course is conducted under the safest conditions possible.</p>
            <p>Every RYA instructor must be highly trained, certified, and experienced both as a sailor and as an educator. Instructors renew qualifications regularly, complete First Aid at Sea training, and attend teaching updates to maintain active RYA recognition.</p>
            <p>Failure to uphold these exacting standards means losing RYA certification ‚Äî a testament to how seriously quality and safety are taken.</p>
