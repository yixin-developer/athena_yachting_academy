          <p>
            You can find our entire fleet departing from Lavrion. We have chosen not to spread our boats in order to ensure that when you arrive at our base, you are personally assisted by our AYA team and everything remains under full control.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lavrion serves as our home base for a number of reasons — most importantly because it lies at the gateway to the Aegean islands, one of the best sailing regions in the world. It’s only <u><b>25 minutes from Athens International Airport</b></u> (Eleftherios Venizelos) and just 16 nautical miles from the first Cycladic island, Kea.
