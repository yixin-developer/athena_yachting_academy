                    <h6>Q: What is the difference between the Yachtmaster Offshore exam and the Yachtmaster Coastal exam?</h6>
                    <p>Both exams test the same things. If you are going for Yachtmaster Offshore (YMO) you will be expected to do it with that much more finesse than if you are going for Yachtmaster Coastal (YMC). You of course also need more experience as a prerequisite to do the YMO.</p>

                    <h6>Q: I haven't logged all my miles. Does that matter?</h6>
                    <p>A: It doesn't matter if you haven't logged all your miles and experience. However the examiner will want to see, on paper, what you have done. So, if you haven't kept a logbook of your mileage then you should list what you have done. For each entry write the dates, the boat name and type, where you went, the max wind strength you encountered, what your position on board was (skipper, mate, crew etc), the number of days your spent on board, the distance logged and whether it was tidal or non tidal, the number of night hours you did and the skipper's name. If you can get the skippers signature even better but not the end of the world if you can't. It is worth mentioning that examiners are pretty good at sussing out when someone may have overly elaborated on their experience!</p>

                    <h6>Q: What constitutes tidal miles?</h6>
                    <p>A: The RYA describe tidal water as being an area where published stream, current or tidal range data is available, and the influence of which is significant enough to require the effects to be taken into account to plan and execute a safe and efficient passage. Some areas in the world don‚Äôt have large tides so are often described as being non-tidal for the purposes of the Yachtmaster exams. These includes places such as the Mediterranean, Baltic, Black Sea, Caribbean, and Caspian Sea. Whilst they may have tides, the tidal range is considered so small (around one foot) that they are not significant enough to be considered tidal waters for your exams. <a href="https://www.rya.org.uk/training/certificates-of-competence/qualifying-passages">More information can be found here.</a></p>

                    <h6>Q: Do I need to have a VHF Radio License, First Aid Qualification or Radar certificate?</h6>
                    <p>A: You need a VHF Radio License. You need a First Aid Certificate - it is possible to get this after your YM exam but you need to do it within a couple of week of the YM exam and examiners much prefer you to have the certificate in advance. You need knowledge of how to operate a radar.</p>

                    <h6>Q: Is Yachtmaster Offshore internationally recognised?</h6>
                    <p>A: The Yachtmaster Offshore Certificate of Competence is an internationally recognised certificate, It is issued by the RYA with authority from the UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA).</p>
                    
                    <h6>Q: Is the assessment &amp; exam practical, theoretical, or both?</h6>
                    <p>A: This Yachtmaster Exam week is not a course! The week includes 5 days of exam preparation focused on intensive ‚ÄúDrills &amp; Skills‚Äù for sailing and docking. Theory is tested‚Äînot taught‚Äîso arrive fully prepared.</p>

                    <h6>Q: What level of experience do you need before you begin?</h6>
                    <p>A: You'll need 2,500 sea miles (under sail, last 10 years), with 50% in tidal waters. For Offshore level: 5 passages of 60NM or more (2 overnight, 2 as skipper). Familiarity with traditional chart navigation, nav theory, and collision regulations is essential.</p>

                    <h6>Q: How long does the Exam Prep &amp; Exam last?</h6>
                    <p>A: The program runs for 7 days. For the prep practice and testing of knowledge, drills and skills, your RYA Instructor has just 5 days with a max of 4 candidates on board to prepare for the remaining 2 days of assessment when your Prep instructor steps off the yacht and is replaced by an independent RYA Examiner.</p>

                    <h6>Q: What are the benefits of completing this assessment?</h6>
                    <p>A: Regardless of the exam outcome, participating in this intensive training week offers valuable experience and skill development. Successfully passing the exam earns you a prestigious certificate that can help lower yacht insurance premiums‚Äîboth for private use and charters‚Äîand serves as a recognized qualification for entering the professional sailing and superyacht industries.</p>

                    <h6>Q: What are the next steps after completing it?</h6>
                    <p>A: You can progress to <a href="/courses/rya-yachtmaster-ocean-theory"><u>RYA Yachtmaster Ocean</u></a> (learn celestial navigation), apply for a commercial endorsement to work professionally, or pursue the RYA Cruising Instructor or Yachtmaster Instructor path.</p>

                    <h6>Q: Does it provide international accreditation?</h6>
                    <p> A: Yes. The RYA Yachtmaster Coastal and Offshore Certificates are internationally recognised and respected by charter companies and the professional sailing industry. The Yachtmaster‚Ñ¢ Certificate of Competence is a prestigious qualification that demonstrates a skipper‚Äôs experience, skill, and competence‚Äîand is often considered the ultimate goal for those pursuing advanced sailing credentials.</p>
                    
                    
                    <h6>Q: What topics will be covered during the week?</h6>
                    <p>A: Key areas of the Yachtmaster syllabus will be practiced, especially those relevant to each individual's needs. There is not time to cover everything from scratch‚Äîprior training is expected.</p>
                    
                    <h6>Q: What will be tested in the theoretical part?</h6>
                    <p>A: Each candidate will be required to prepare and present a theoretical passage plan, using materials such as an almanac, charts, and a weather synopsis. Those attending training in the weeks prior to the exam will receive these materials in advance. During the exam, candidates must present their plans to the examiner, who will also assess their understanding of navigational theory and Collision Regulations‚Äîincluding buoyage, lights, shapes, and sound signals.</p>

                  <p class="lead">The instructor will help you to ensure you are as prepared as possible by focusing on the areas you need most improvement and ironing out any bad habits you may have. You will be pushed hard. You will enter and leave as many ports/harbours as possible. You will practice night sailing and blind navigation. You will go over all the lights, shapes, sound signals and collision regulations. It is not a requirement to do such a course before the exam however it is well worth doing it if only to find out your strengths and weaknesses.</p>
                  <p class="lead">A Yachtmaster Offshore should be able to enter any well-charted harbour for the first time, with sufficient depth, by day or night.</p>
                  <p class="lead">You will sail mainly along Maltese Coast and will visit as many places as possible so that you are familiar with them before the exam.</p>
                  <p class="lead">Malta is an excellent location to take your Yachtmaster Offshore exam. Its a small island country with non-tidal waters, providing an easier and simpler environment for the exam, while the consistent sunshine, reliable winds, and clear sea conditions allow for better exam conditions. </p>

Candidates will be set tasks to demonstrate their ability as skipper of an offshore cruising yacht and may also be asked questions on any part of the syllabus for all courses except Yachtmaster Ocean.</p>
                  <p class="lead">Examiners are independent assessors not involved in training candidates and are therefore objective when assessing ability. The RYA examines candidates on behalf of the UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency.</p>
                  <p class="lead">The RYA examiner will meet you onboard and talk through the plan. Examiners understand you could be nervous and will do their best to allay your fears and make sure you are clear about what they want you to do. They are there to find out what you can do, not to pick holes.</p>
                  <p class="lead">Please note that the exam fee can be paid directly to the RYA (we will send you details of how to pay) and is not included in the course fee.</p>

                  <p class="lead">A good skipper leads the crew and communicates with them, making sure they understand what is going on and listening to them when they have something to say. They do not shout a stream of commands, leaving their crew in a quivering mess. Quiet competence instils confidence, helping your crew feel safe in the knowledge that the right decisions are being made.</p>
                  <p class="lead">There are three RYA Certificates of Competence:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Yachtmaster Coastal Certificate of Competence</li>
                    <li>Yachtmaster Offshore Certificate of Competence</li>
                    <li>Yachtmaster Ocean Certificate of Competence</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="lead">The theory is the same for Yachtmaster Coastal and Yachtmaster Offshore. The difference is that less practical experience is required for the Coastal exam. The Yachtmaster Ocean involves astronavigation. See the details for the shorebased course <a href="/courses/rya-yachtmaster-ocean-theory"><u>Here.</u></a></p>
                  <p class="lead">Certificates of competence are some of the most useful and credible of yachting qualifications. They thoroughly test the skipper's ability, and can therefore appear daunting to potential candidates. But well prepared skippers with the right experience needn't worry. With the practice and preparation you get from doing the prep course, you should be able to relax sufficiently to let your skills shine through any exam nerves.</p>

                  <p class="lead"><b>Showers/Facilities: </b>Whilst we do have showers on board the yacht but most nights you will be in a marina with good hot showers and shore side facilities in a Marina.</p>
                  <p class="lead"><b>Food: </b>We have a fully stocked kitchen on board the yacht. We usually provide some snacks onboard. That means there will be plenty of water, fruit, but also a supply of chocolate and biscuits. Students usually do food shopping at the beginning of the course for the entire course duration on their own costs. You will be able to bring your own food if you wish.</p>
                  <p class="lead">If you have any special dietary requirements, we can normally accommodate these. Just let us know when you fill out your booking form.</p>

                  <p class="lead">Malta International Airport (MLA) is well connected to many European cities, especially major hubs. Upon arrival, you‚Äôll find a taxi kiosk just outside the terminal where you can prepay for a ride to Manoel Island Yacht Marina ‚Äî a 20-minute journey that typically costs around ‚Ç¨25. Taxi drivers speak good English, and for a more budget-friendly option, ride-hailing apps like Bolt and eCabs are widely available and easy to use.</p>

This way you can start getting to know the yacht, the instructor, and crew mates before the course really gets under way. If this is not possible then you need to be at the boat by 9.00am on the first day of the Sailing Course.</p>
                  <p class="lead">You can expect to get away by 16.30pm on the final day of your exam, possibly earlier. If you will catch a flight, its better to departure after 18:00.</p>
