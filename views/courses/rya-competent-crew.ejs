                      Your <strong>RYA Competent Crew Course</strong> takes place aboard our comfortable and well-equipped Bavaria 44 Cruiser yacht, ‚ÄúAthrna‚Äù. She is moored at lavrio Port, conveniently located near the Paparazzi restaurant. Boarding begins at <strong>9:00 AM on the first day</strong> of your course.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Onboard accommodation</strong> during the course (typically Monday to Friday) is included in the course fee. Early boarding on Sunday evening or staying aboard Friday night may be arranged upon request ‚Äî just let us know in advance!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      While most training days return to the marina each evening, the <strong>RYA Competent Crew syllabus</strong> may include some <strong>night sailing experience</strong>, depending on weather conditions. This offers a fantastic opportunity to gain real-world crew experience in a safe and supportive setting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As part of your <strong>Competent Crew course in Greece</strong>, we‚Äôll sail around the beautiful Saronic Gulf Islands. The journey includes scenic anchorages, peaceful bays, and charming harbours ‚Äî with plenty of time to go ashore, relax, explore historical sites, or enjoy delicious local cuisine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Greece offers consistent winds and sunny weather <strong>year-round</strong>, making it the perfect place to learn to sail and develop your <strong>competent crew skills</strong>. Whether you're a beginner or looking to build hands-on <strong>crew experience</strong>, this course is the ideal foundation. On successful completion, you‚Äôll be awarded the official <strong>RYA Competent Crew Certificate</strong> ‚Äî a recognised credential worldwide and a valuable step in your sailing journey.

                    <p><strong>A Day Onboard</strong></p>
                    <p>Life as crew starts relaxed: breakfast in the cockpit, a chat about the day ahead and a good coffee. Then it‚Äôs lines off and sails up: your first chance to take the helm, trim the sails, and learn the ropes (literally!). Along the way, you‚Äôll pick up essential theory too: basic navigation, safety rules, and the nautical terms every sailor needs to know.</p>
                    <p>Around midday we anchor in a calm bay for lunch on board. There‚Äôs time for a swim, snorkel, or simply relaxing on deck before we set off again. Out on open water, you‚Äôll get to practise lookout duties and simple chart work, and if you‚Äôre lucky, dolphins may join us along the way.</p>
                    <p>In the afternoon we focus on teamwork: practising knots, handling the dinghy, and helping to bring the yacht safely into harbour. Once ashore, there‚Äôs time to wander through the village, enjoy a drink by the water, and finish the day with a relaxed meal in a local taverna with souvlaki, tzatziki, and other Greek favourites.</p>

                    <p>If you‚Äôre flying to Greece, the nearest airport is <strong>Athens International Airport (ATH) ‚Äì Eleftherios Venizelos</strong>.

                    <p>Our marina base is located in <strong>Lavrio</strong>, just a <strong>20‚Äì25 minute drive from Athens International Airport</strong>. This makes it one of the most convenient sailing bases in Greece, especially for those joining RYA courses or yacht charters.</p>
                    <p>Upon arrival, you‚Äôll find <strong>official taxi stands</strong> right outside the arrivals hall. Simply tell the driver your destination:

                      The journey typically costs between <strong>‚Ç¨35‚Äì‚Ç¨45</strong> depending on traffic and time of day, and takes about 20 minutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>Alternatively, you can use ride-hailing apps such as <strong>Bolt</strong> or <strong>Uber</strong> for a convenient and often more affordable transfer. Several airport shuttle and private transfer services also operate between Athens Airport and Lavrio.</p>
                    <p>When you arrive at the marina, you‚Äôll receive a short <strong>boat and safety briefing</strong> to get familiar with the yacht, meet your crew, and settle in before your course or sailing adventure begins.</p>
