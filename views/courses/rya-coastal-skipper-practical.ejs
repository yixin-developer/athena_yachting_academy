                      <p><strong>RYA Coastal Skipper</strong> is the next major step in your sailing journey after completing the <strong>RYA Day Skipper</strong> courses. If you're aiming for a <strong>professional sailing career</strong> or looking to <strong>advance your skippering skills</strong>, this is the essential course that bridges the gap to the prestigious <strong>RYA Yachtmaster‚Ñ¢ qualification</strong>.</p>

                      <p>Designed for experienced <strong>RYA Day Skippers</strong>, the <strong>Coastal Skipper Practical course</strong> builds the skills and confidence needed to plan and skipper <strong>longer and more challenging coastal passages</strong>, including <strong>night sailing</strong> and <strong>watch-keeping systems</strong>.</p>

                      <p>You will learn to take full command of a yacht, managing both the boat and the crew over extended passages. With your <strong>RYA instructor</strong> on board for support and guidance, you'll gain hands-on experience in real-world scenarios.</p>

                      <p>Like the Day Skipper course, this practical training is based on a series of <strong>skippered passages</strong>, but at a significantly higher level. You'll develop advanced skills in <strong>passage planning</strong>, <strong>pilotage by day and night</strong>, <strong>yacht handling</strong>, and managing <strong>emergency situations</strong>.</p>

                      <p>This is an <strong>intensive but rewarding week</strong>, with each trainee expected to take full responsibility under various conditions. Upon successful completion, you will be awarded the <strong>RYA Coastal Skipper Practical Certificate</strong> ‚Äî an <strong>internationally recognised qualification</strong> used for <strong>yacht chartering</strong> and a critical milestone toward your <strong>Yachtmaster‚Ñ¢ Certificate of Competence</strong>.</p>

                      <p>It is <strong>highly recommended</strong> that you complete the <a href="/courses/rya-coastal-skipper-yachtmaster-offshore-theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><u>RYA Coastal Skipper/Yachtmaster‚Ñ¢ Offshore Theory course</u></strong></a> before joining the practical week, as there is not enough time to cover theory during the training.</p>

                      <p>By the end of this course, you‚Äôll be capable of handling <strong>coastal passages by day and night</strong>, navigating in reduced visibility, executing <strong>advanced boat handling under sail and power</strong>, and anchoring in more demanding conditions. You‚Äôll have the <strong>knowledge and confidence to skipper a yacht safely</strong> in coastal waters ‚Äî and be well on your way to becoming a <strong>Yachtmaster‚Ñ¢</strong>.</p>

                      <p>This certification can also be <strong>MCA-endorsed</strong> for <strong>commercial sailing purposes</strong>.</p>

                    <p>It highly recommended to take <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/courses/rya-marine-radio"><em>RYA Marine Radio VHF course</em></a>. VHF course will be useful if you want to do chartering in the future, because you are required to hold a VHF certificate for that purpose. The course is designed and created by RYA, and it will be given online. Once you complete the online course, you will have a 30 minutes exam with us during your stay in Malta. Usually it takes 1-2 days to complete. You can do it before, during, or after CSP course.
                    <p>We also recommend you to take
                      <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/courses/rya-first-aid">RYA First Aid course</a>. The RYA First Aid course is designed to teach you exactly what to do in these situations. From the minor ailments such as headaches, sunburn and small lesions through to the immediate response to serious medical emergencies. This course covers the situations that a yachtsman is likely to encounter. This course is a must for all who sail, and skippers should encourage their crews to attend. Remember it may be you who needs attention! At the completion of the course you will be issued with the RYA Small Craft First Aid Certificate. This certificate is valid for 3 years from the time of issue and is a prerequisite for those taking the Coastal Skipper / Yachtmaster Offshore Examinations.
                    </p>
