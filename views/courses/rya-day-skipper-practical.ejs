                    <strong>RYA Day Skipper Practical</strong> is a must for skippers who wish to take out their family and friends, the entry level to skippering and a minimum qualification.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The course is designed to teach you to "take charge" safely and confidently. A skipper does much more than navigate. He/She is responsible for the complete safety and wellbeing of the yacht and crew.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The student will learn to skipper a short passage with the instructor on hand to give advice and encouragement and ensure your safety, have the experience being in charge and taking control of the yacht and the crew.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      There is particular emphasis on <strong>boat handling</strong> for Day Skippers and during the course you will practice mooring under various conditions. For those who need extra practicing and training of boat manoeuvring, we have a special <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href="/courses/boat-handling-course"><u>Boat Handling Course</u></a> for that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Along the course, you will visit some great harbours, nice bays, and anchorages to practice pilotage techniques which, like boat handling, is an essential skill for the aspiring skipper. You will complete at least 4 night hours sailing to experience night pilotage and identify lights.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Upon the completion of the course, the student is expected to be able to skipper a small yacht in familiar waters by day. Students who successfully complete the Day Skipper course are awarded the RYA Day Skipper practical course completion certificate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      RYA Day Skipper Practical licence is the entry level and the minimum requirement for chartering yachts in many locations around the world, <strong>coupled it with your <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href="/courses/rya-marine-radio"><u>Marine Radio VHF license</u></a></strong>. This course will also enable you to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href="/courses/icc-assessment"><u><strong>apply for the ICC</strong></u></a> (International Certificate of Competence, limited to certain nationalities).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The course lasts 5 days. Each day the course starts at 09:30 and ends at around 17:00 (except for the day of night sail). The course is usually run from Monday to Friday every week. Accommodation onboard during the course is included in the course price.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      You are also welcome to charter the whole yacht for yourself and take your RYA Day Skipper course in a more relaxed way for yourself and friends/family (they can take their RYA Competent Crew course with you at same time,  up to 5 students per course).

                      <strong>Learn to Skipper a Yacht with Confidence ‚Äì RYA Day Skipper Practical Course in Greece</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Master the essential skills to confidently skipper a small sailing yacht by day with the 
                      <strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href="/courses/rya-day-skipper-practical">RYA Day Skipper Practical course</a></strong>. 
                      Based in beautiful Greece, this hands-on 5-day sailing course covers key topics including coastal navigation, passage planning, practical pilotage, seamanship, and boat handling‚Äîsuch as Med-style mooring, a must for sailing in the Mediterranean.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Unlike a traditional exam, assessment is continuous and based on your ability to safely skipper the yacht throughout the course. 
                      If your instructor confirms that you're competent and safe to take a small yacht to sea in moderate conditions, 
                      you‚Äôll be awarded the <strong>RYA Day Skipper certificate</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Depending on your citizenship and residency, you may also be able to convert your certificate to an ICC (International Certificate of Competence), opening opportunities to charter worldwide.                    </p>
                    <p>
                      You‚Äôll be training aboard Athena,‚Äù a spacious Bavaria 44 Cruiser moored at 
                      <strong>Lavrion Port</strong> in 20 minutes by car from Athens International Airport. 
                      The course begins daily at 09:30, and onboard accommodation is available and included from Monday to Friday. 
                      Early boarding on Sunday or staying Friday night is possible by request.

                    <p><strong>A Day Onboard</strong></p>
                    <p>The day begins with a shared breakfast on deck, enjoying coffee and pastries while the instructor briefs the crew on the route, weather, and key responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>Once underway, it‚Äôs hands-on sailing: trimming sails, steering under sail and power, and taking turns as skipper, making decisions confidently and managing the yacht with the crew.</p>
                    <p>At lunchtime, we drop anchor in a sheltered bay to enjoy a meal on board, with time to swim, snorkel, or relax in the sun. The afternoon continues with practising Med-mooring, navigation, and precise harbour manoeuvres.</p>
                    <p>As the day ends, we sail into a harbour, explore a nearby village, enjoy a drink at a terrace, and finish with dinner at a local taverna, featuring classic Greek dishes like moussaka, fresh seafood, and Greek salad.</p>

                    <p>Our marina base is located in <strong>Lavrio</strong>, just a <strong>20‚Äì25 minute drive from Athens International Airport</strong>. This makes it one of the most convenient sailing bases in Greece, especially for those joining RYA courses or yacht charters.</p>
                    <p>Upon arrival, you‚Äôll find <strong>official taxi stands</strong> right outside the arrivals hall. Simply tell the driver your destination:

                      The journey typically costs between <strong>‚Ç¨35‚Äì‚Ç¨45</strong> depending on traffic and time of day, and takes about 20 minutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>Alternatively, you can use ride-hailing apps such as <strong>Bolt</strong> or <strong>Uber</strong> for a convenient and often more affordable transfer. Several airport shuttle and private transfer services also operate between Athens Airport and Lavrio.</p>
